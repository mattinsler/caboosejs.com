  <h2>Background</h2>
  <p>
    Caboose is the product of many apps I&apos;ve built.  Most sites I've worked on don't require much more than a simple MVC setup.
    I end up building the same structure over and over again using the same set of tools.  Then I started working with
    <a href="http://rubyonrails.org/">Ruby on Rails</a> and realized that all that boilerplate code is taken care of for me.  Rails
    makes it easy to concentrate on the business logic, not the core plumbing.  I liked the simplicity and started building caboose to
    scratch my own itch.
  </p>
  <p>
    It really comes down to how I like to work.  I believe in simple, predictable architecture and making my life easier.  Many of the
    features in caboose are absolutely unnecessary, but they are just the way I like to work.  I know most of the node community supports
    a POSIX-like structure of many small packages that you can assemble into your application.  I think this works incredibly well, but forces
    you to evaluate and learn many different packages to create a single app.  My personal preference is to be productive as quickly as
    possible and find new and interesting packages when I need something more complex.  I built caboose to handle that 80% case when you just
    need something that works.  Anything further and you'll need to dive deep, just like any other framework out there.
